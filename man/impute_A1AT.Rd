}
\value{
A vector of A1AT measurements ranging between 0.64--2.58 mg/L.
}
\description{
Imputes the concentrations of A1AT from serum NMR measurements in healthy
population-based samples.
}
\details{
The imputation models will only return a concentration where no input
 measurements were missing, and where all input measurements were within
 their acceptable predefined range of values. These correspond to their
 range of values in the training dataset. Similarly, the imputed measurement
 will be set to missing if the imputation model returns a concentration
 outside the range of values that were found in the training dataset.
